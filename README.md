### Fun Projects

- [ChangeBase](https://spejamchr.github.io/chbsrs/) - Convert between different number systems (including bases greater than 36 and non-integer bases). I made this to see what familiar numbers looked like in base-`e` and base-`pi`.
- [string_art](https://github.com/spejamchr/string_art) - A CLI that can transform an image into string art
- [Discover Automata](https://discover-automata.vercel.app/) - Explore 1D cellular automata in the browser: customize the automata's rules & color themes.
- [Jotter](https://github.com/spejamchr/jotter) - Convert between [Lambda Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), [Combinatory Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic), and [Jot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_and_Jot#Jot). Also, show the Jot program as a number. This makes it easier to see there are a countably-infinite number of possible programs (not uncountably-infinite).
- [TSudemic](https://github.com/spejamchr/tsudemic) - A toy pandemic simulator, with configurable parameters for infectious period & range, population size/density, and more.
- [Valcity](https://valcity.vercel.app/) - A simple projectile physics simulator that includes configurable wind resistance & inelastic collision/bouncing.
- [Wikm](https://wikm.vercel.app/) - Explore Wikipedia: search for any topic on Wikipedia, and get an mind-map. Then click & double-click the topics to see summaries & explore.
- [Mandel](https://github.com/spejamchr/mandel) - A CLI project that renders the Mandelbrot set, but can only be configured by changing the source code. Makes pretty pictures.
- [unties](https://spejamchr.github.io/unties/) - A Python 3 units-handling package I wrote in college to make my engineering homework easier.
